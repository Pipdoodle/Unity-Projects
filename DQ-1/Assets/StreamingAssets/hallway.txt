		Text: [Parent's Room]  Hey, it's my parents room. I remember I used to go to their room all the time when I was younger and just sleep in their bed. It's so big and fluffy! Mom and Dad would always grumble about it, but in the end they would always let me stay and read me a bedtime story! It's been years since I've done that though... Sometimes I miss it...

		Text: [Parent's Room] Great, it's my parents room. They're probably in there talking about what a  disappointment I am. Who needs their parents to make sure they wake up? I just mess up everything.

		Text: [Guest Room] It's the guest room. You know what's unfair? The fact that the guest room has a fluffier bed than mine. I should just steal the bed in there... pick it up and just carry it in my room. I'm sure noone would notice, right? Okay I should really get to school!
