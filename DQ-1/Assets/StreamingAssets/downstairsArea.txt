		Text: [Television] I used to love watching TV... Phineas and Ferb... playing Brawl... I'd get such a thrill cheering them on, pretending it was me... now there's just nothing.

		Text: [Dining Room] I never really understood the need for dining rooms. Like it's not like we eat here or anything, it just sits here gathering dust, figuratively... mom would never let dust actually gather. Imagine what people would think! Oh the horror, dust! Eh either way, I will never understand social norms!

    Else:
        Text: [Dining Room] Everything's perfectly polished, not a speck of dust. In the center, a single glass vase with the fake blooming flower... the perfect dining room representing the perfect family to showcase to the outside world... what does that remind me of?
